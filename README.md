ðŸ’§ Water Quality Prediction App

This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts whether water is safe to drink based on its chemical properties. The app uses a trained machine learning model (model.pkl) and allows users to enter parameters like pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity.

Info of the data set:
  This is a set of data created from imaginary data of water quality in an urban environment. I recommend using this dataset for educational purposes, for practice and to acquire the necessary knowledge.
  

Description
All attributes are numeric variables and they are listed bellow:

aluminium - dangerous if greater than 2.8
ammonia - dangerous if greater than 32.5
arsenic - dangerous if greater than 0.01
barium - dangerous if greater than 2
cadmium - dangerous if greater than 0.005
chloramine - dangerous if greater than 4
chromium - dangerous if greater than 0.1
copper - dangerous if greater than 1.3
flouride - dangerous if greater than 1.5
bacteria - dangerous if greater than 0
viruses - dangerous if greater than 0
lead - dangerous if greater than 0.015
nitrates - dangerous if greater than 10
nitrites - dangerous if greater than 1
mercury - dangerous if greater than 0.002
perchlorate - dangerous if greater than 56
radium - dangerous if greater than 5
selenium - dangerous if greater than 0.5
silver - dangerous if greater than 0.1
uranium - dangerous if greater than 0.3
is_safe - class attribute {0 - not safe, 1 - safe}

Use Case

This app is useful for demonstrating how machine learning can assist in environmental monitoring and public health
decisions by providing quick assessments of water potability.
